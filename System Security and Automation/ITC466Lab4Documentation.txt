Downloaded it-

mdadm –create /dev/md0
mdadm –create –verbose /dev/md0 –level=5 –raid-devices=3 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdd

Added to etc/exports
/srv/nfsroot 10.0.0.0/24(ro,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
Downloaded syslinux, located in /usr/lib/ directory
Confused between /etc/exports and a file named etc.exports inside the nfs-kernel-server, not sure where to put similar command as mentioned in 2a.
Whether it goes in the NFS2 folders or the consecutive (NSF3-5) folders is what we can’t figure out
Added the debian on the bind reverse and the ns config screen
Installed tftp on ns1
/etc/default sudo vim tfpd-hpa
Changed the directory to: /mnt/ns1lookup

Our router domain name is a site that is making it so we can’t access the router
We needed to reinstall tftp on the servers and in order to do the automated backup, we need the router  to work
Changed the IP domain name to group5.itc instead of what it was (group5.net) and it still won’t work
Created a directory: tftpbackup
etc/host.allow ALL: (router IP)192.168.209.89, 10.2.8.4, 10.2.8.5, 10.2.8.6, 172.16.48.241, 10.2.8.1
etc/host.deny ALL: PARANOID (denies everything but the allowed IPs)
Installed ntp for the time stamps
The time was incorrect, but the date was correct
Created the Microtek automatic backup
4am, every one day
Mounted ns1 yesterday, ns2 today-
/mnt mount –v debian.group5.itc:/mnt/ns1backup /mnt/ns1backup
/mnt mount –v debian.group5.itc:/mnt/ns2backup /mnt/ns2backup
/mnt cd ns1backup
/mnt/ns1backup echo “hello world” >> test
Read the test file with either: ‘vim test’ or ‘cat test’
umount /mnt/ns1backup
Created a script to synchronize the backups
Created a file- vim ns1backups.sh
Modified the file with the script
http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2003/03/06/nfs_backup.html
Downloaded and configured Cron for the time and date on ns1, ns2
sudo apt-get install gnome-schedule
sudo crontab -e
0 04 * * 0 root /mnt/ns1backup/ns1backups.sh

Added the c2960x (10.2.8.2) to the ns1: sudo vi /etc/bind/bd.group5.itc
Added the c1841(172.16.48.241) to the ns1: sudo vi /etc/bind/bd.group5.itc
Fileserver works, tftp wasn’t installed correctly- that’s why it didn’t work (it was looking for a file and not the program)
RAID5 not mounted- made it permanent fstab
blkid /dev/md0
Created the tftpbackup dir
Can now mount the mnt with one command by: mount /mnt
The only allowed IPs in the tftp should be the network routers (no ns1/2 or win)
(Read)Deliverables- the DNS entries
Added the DNS and ssh to the ciscos and microtik
Need to check to see if the ESIx has a DNS name
Created the microtik on the ospf win box-
