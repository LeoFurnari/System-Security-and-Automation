Documentation for the Network Setup lab

When: Feb 2, 2016; 6:45pm

What: Our target purpose for this time around is just to get everything set up and installed so when we come back a different day, we won’t have to worry about the installation process.

How/Why:

We used a bootable USB in order to get the Win 10 box, we used port 107 to achieve the Debian download since it was on the network.

interface FastEthernet0/0/0

 switchport access vlan 10

 no ip address

-This command gave us access to a VLAN that we created. We needed it to create a network.

interface Vlan10
 ip address 172.16.53.2 255.255.255.0
 ip nat outside
 ip virtual-reassembly in
-Here we set up a usable IP address so that we can connect to it from other devices.

 

Quick notes from during lab times:

Tower 1 = Win 10

Tower 2 = Debian

Tower 3 = ESXi 6.0

Used Port 107 to achieve Debian download

192.168.88.1/webfig (site)

IP address: 172.16.48.187

MAC: D4 CA 60 0E 2D FB

Gateway: 172.16.48.161

Default DHCP Server Range: 192.168.88.10 – 192.16.88.25

Auto IP when not connected to the win server- 169.254.89.27

Remoted into a computer through SSH for router configuration- 141.209.98.157: didn’t work

Downloaded Putty for further access: didn’t work

Tried to configure router from the other side (Adele style) with Putty

Through Putty, we tried out the cidr mask command to make it easier to get the subnet mask: didn’t work

Realized we had a cord in the wrong port (layer 2)- then we assigned the IP Address 10.2.8.1 to fast Ethernet 0/0

Used the command ‘do sh run’ to get the IP information we needed to figure out what to set the IP to a different switch so we can create the gateway of last resort- didn’t really work

Followed the Fig 2/ Table 3 gig- switched out a cord and tried to assign the Win Server to the Cisco 1841 by setting an IP up on the VLAN

Set up the IP NAT inside/ outside

The Ethernet has a warning sign instead of an X. IP given in that warning was 172.16.48.2

Port 111 fa0/0

 

When: Feb 7, 2016; 12:30pm

What: We tried to get the SSH working between the lab computer and our group computer so we wouldn’t have to run around to the other side constantly. This helped us be able to configure the router from one computer.

How/Why:

group5(config)#int vlan 2
group5(config-if)#i
*Feb  7 17:37:54.829: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Vlan2, changed state to downp
% Incomplete command.
 
 
group5(config-if)#ip address 192.168.209.95 255.255.255.248
Bad mask /29 for address 192.168.209.95
group5(config-if)#ip address 192.168.209.1 255.255.255.248
 

group5(config-if)#switchport access vlan 2
-Gave us access to put the VLAN 2 settings onto the switch

group5(config)#int vlan 2
group5(config-if)#no  ip address 192.168.209.1 255.255.255.248
group5(config-if)# ip address 192.168.209.1 255.255.255.248
group5(config-if)#no  ip address 192.168.209.1 255.255.255.248
group5(config-if)#ip address 192.168.209.89 255.255.255.248
-Put an IP onto the VLAN 2

 

These are the configurations we used for the switch.

Switch#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#hostname s1
s1(config)#
-We configured a name for it for easier recognition later.

s1(config)#int vlan 2
s1(config-if)#no ip address 10.2.8.2 255.255.254.0
s1(config-if)#ip address 10.2.8.2 255.255.255.0
s1(config-if)#exit
s1(config)#int vlan 3
s1(config-if)#ip address 10.2.9.1 255.255.255.0
s1(config-if)#no ip address 10.2.9.1 255.255.255.0
s1(config-if)#ip address 10.2.9.2 255.255.255.0
-We gave the VLANs usable IPs.
 
s1(config)#int gigabitEthernet 1/0/3
s1(config-if)#switchport access vlan 2
% Access VLAN does not exist. Creating vlan 2
-Created VLAN 2

s1(config)#int gi1/0/2
s1(config-if)#switchport access vlan 3
% Access VLAN does not exist. Creating vlan 3
-Created VLAN 3

group5(config)#ip route 192.168.209.88 255.255.255.248 172.16.48.242
 

 

Quick notes from during lab times:

New IP: 192.168.209.89

Subnet: 255.255.255.248

Gateway: 192.168.209.89

Preferred DNS server: 172.16.48.2

Removed the IP the f/e- 0/0

Swapped the IP on the 0x link, changed the Win box’s IP and got SSH to work

Had to change the IP and Gateway to keep it in our block of broadcast- made SSH not work

Took the server network (given) and split it in half so that the file and ESXi server can have their own VLAN. But it wasn’t able to be put on the same network.

 

When: Feb 7, 2016; 7:30pm

What: We tried to finish up the lab with the last bit of trunking and deliverables. Some complications arose, but we did our best.

How/Why:      

s1(config)#int vlan 105
s1(config-if)#172.16.48.242 255.255.255.252
             ^
% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.
s1(config-if)#ip add 172.16.48.242 255.255.255.252
-Added the indicated IP to the indicated VLAN.

s1(config)#int gi1/0/1
s1(config-if)#switchport access vlan 105
% Access VLAN does not exist. Creating vlan 105
-Created the VLAN 105 on the switchport.

Quick notes from during lab times:

Tried to get trunking working between the two networks

Established an SSH for the Catalyst switch

Tried to create a static route on the management network so it could reach the server network

Trunking on Catalyst switch gi1/0/1

VLAN 105 on both the RouterBOARD and the Cisco 1841

 

When: Feb 8, 2016; 3:15pm

What: Last ditch effort to finish the lab

How/Why:

group5(config-subif)#
group5(config-subif)# ip address 172.16.48.241 255.255.255.252
-Created the virtual interface of the VLAN 105 and created it’s IP address

 

Quick notes from during lab times:

Got rid of the 3 IP routes that were previously created

Created a virtual interface on the fa0/0 with the command fa0/0.105, which created the 105 VLAN

An IP to that interface was then added

Tried to create the gateway of last resort on the 1841
