March 19, 2016- 7pm

Downloaded and installed Win Server2012, opened in VSphere
Configured NTP (mikrotik was already set up)
Windows box
Changed the time zone to Eastern
Just went to the clock feature and changed the time zone, then refreshed the NTP server
Cisco 2960:
ntp server 172.16.48.2 prefer
clock summer-time EST recurring
Cisco 1841:
ntp source vlan105
clock summer-time EST recurring
For Active Directory:
God link: http://sharepointgeorge.com/2012/configuring-active-directory-ad-ds-in-windows-server-2012/ (below is condensed version)
We changed the computer name to WindowsServer.
When adding the Active Directory Domain Services Role…
Went through the options and…
Add roles and features
Go to Installation Type
Choose Role-base or feature-based installation.
Go to Server Selection
Choose WindowsServer from the server pool.
From Server Roles
Choose Active Directory Domain Services
Features
Only selected (and these were the ‘pre-selected’ options):
Group Policy Management
.NET Framework 4.5 Features(2 of 7 installed)
Remote Server Administration Tools
SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support (Installed)
User Interfaces and Infrastructure (2 of 3 installed)
Windows PowerShell (2 of 5 installed)
WoW64 Support (Installed)
AD DS
Notes about the items installed and such:
Installing AD DS will also install the DFS Namespaces, DFS Replication, and File Replication services which are required by AD DS
AD DS requires a DNS server to be installed on the network. If you do not have a DNS server installed, you will be prompted to install the DNS server role on this machine.
To help ensure that users can still log on to the network in the case of a server outage, install a minimum of two domain controllers for a domain.
Results
Restart destination server automatically if required not checked.
Install Features
Feature installation - Configuration required. Installation succeeded on WindowsServer.
Finito
Then we needed to configure the deployment…
Going through the options…
Saw that the AD DS appears in left navigation area in Server Manager, so that’s what was clicked upon.
Clicked MORE on alert indicating that Configuration is needed.
Promote server to domain controller under Action.
Add a new forest, and insert root domain (group5.itc)
Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password- our usual
We got a funky error message:
The DNS Options- ‘A delegation for this DNS server cannot be created because the authoritative parent zone cannot be found or it does not run Windows DNS server. …’

March 22, 2016- 10am
 
DNS Manager
Added Reverse Lookup Zones
Right click for New zone
Next (primary zone)

DNS Server: 172.16.48.2
 
In DNS (ns1 /etc/bind# ls ) change the DNS master and slave to forward zones (web page for this is up)
 
Furnari, Noall, Tingley
March 24, 2016- 6pm
 
Modified the ns1 DNS forward files
/etc/bind$ sudo vim named.conf.local
type forward;
forward only;
also-notify (IP for the ns1/2);
forwards (
sudo apt-get install samba (on ns1([global] section alterations done ONLY here)/ns2/debian)
smb.conf
[global] section
vfs objects = acl_xattr
map acl inherit = yes
store dos attributes = yes
read only = no
[homes]
read only = no
[ourfiles]
Comment = home directories
Read only = no
locking = no
path = /root/home/
guest ok = no
added a new password
sudo smbpasswd –a (name)
(password)
sudo pbdedit –w –L
sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
sudo apt-get install sssd (ns1)
Said ‘yes’ to the question it asked
Created an sssd.conf file
vim sssd.conf
Then added/ wrote
[sssd]
domains = group5.itc
config_file_version = 2
services = nss, pam
default_domain_suffix = GROUP5

[domain/group5.itc]
ad_domain = group5.itc

id_provider = ad
krb5_store_password_if_offline = True
default_shell = /bin/bash
ldap_id_mapping = True
use_fully_qualified_names = False
fallback_homedir = /home/%d/%u
access_provider = ad
sudo apt-get install realmd (ns1)
Said ‘yes’ to the question it asked (takes up a certain amount of disk space)
sudo realm join --user=noall1ka group5.itc
chmod 600 sssd.conf
 

 
KNOW HOW TO DO THE BACKUPS. DO NOT DO THE AUTHENS WITHOUT THE BACKUPS.
Win support in [global] section of the smb.conf
Do we have to change the ns2 DNS slave to the forward zones as well? If so, how? The DNS manager is throwing an error: automated test query failed- why?

Changed the commands of the tar file in Debian
root /mnt/debianbackup debianbackups.sh
tar –cpzf
Create; preserving files and directory permissions; tells tar to compress the files further to reduce the size of tar file; allows tar to get file name
Put a space in between /usr/home/nick and /usr/home/ifconfig
Had to create the backup files for ns1 and ns2
Used the same file as debian
ns2: ns2backups.sh
ns1: ns1backups.sh
Cron is in the /etc directory
Tar files (http://www.aboutdebian.com/tar-backup.htm)
Debian (/mnt/debianbackup)
backup.tar.gz
ns1 (/mnt/ns1backup)
backup.tar.gz
ns2 (/mnt/ns2backup)
backup.tar.gz
TO CHECK THE FILES
Go into the folder files (/mnt/debianbackup)
Then type: tar -tf backup.tar.gz
All 3 (ns1, ns2, debian) checked out with this line.
TO DO A FULL RESTORE (/mnt/fullbackup)
tar –zxvpf /fullbackup.tar.gz
 
 
Lucas- ask to see if the is done correctly (as well as the other backup files).

Changed DNS server IP 172.16.48.2
Unchecks IPv6
Allowed remote access in DNS manager
Added 10.2.8.3 onto the remote access in Royal TS
Renamed the winserver on the DNS manager
Added 172.16.48 into the reverse lookup zones in DNS M
Added the host of c1841, c2960s, and debian
Changed the ns1 /etc/bind named.conf.local file (got rid of a few lines)
Changed ^ in ns2 (got rid of a few lines and added the forwarders line
Restarted bind9 after both
HAD to change the ESXi IP to 10.2.8.7
Added this as a host in the DNS M
Changed the win10 box’s name and domain
Resolved the name (winserver.group5.itc.) and a few of the IPs (10.2.8.3) all throughout the DNS M (make sure the name is right when creating it.. makes it easier for later times)
 
Royal TS is in public(?)
Radius (mikrotik, boards), sssd (debian (do ns1 first) make snapshots),
 
Noall, Tingley
March 29, 2016; 10:30am
 
Created a home directory in debian mnt folder
Removed samba from ns1, ns2 (should only be on debian)
GET SSSD INSTALLED AND CONFIGURED BEFORE SAMBA.
Got sssd semi-started (web page should be up)
join_ad.sh
joined group: group5.itc
Under noall1ka as an admin
Changed the use_fully_qualified to false
Did this in the sssd.conf file
Added a domain to the resolv.conf
And a nameserver
AD U&C
Changed Lucas’s user- he made it himself (but
Debian
Changed the realms in the etc/krb5.conf
And the domain_name
apt-get install sssd-krb5-
Added wins server to the roles and features
 
Noall
March 29, 2016; 2:40pm
 
Removed debian from the joined realm
Tried to join it to the adcli
Added realmd sssd to ns1
 
Noall
March 29, 2016; 4:45pm
 
Lucas wiped the server (dns, adds) and created the domain from scratch…
Broke Lucas
resolv.conf can’t be changed or removed
SOLVED: chattr –i resolv.conf
ns2
krb5.conf
realms group5.itc was changed/ added to
domain_realm was added to
 
Check the config to be sure (he’s pretty sure it’s right)
(3)Create home directory (linux to linux, linux to win)- do not auto create- on the RAID5 (share them out- share from fileserver to ns1/ns2, understand how it works then go for the other ones) that is shared out by the fileserver- automatically go to the home directory (sssd and samba closely related- sharing them out and mount (L:drive(win) possibly done in the properties))
(2)Radius- mikrotik, boards
//Win10 needs to be rejoined to the domain
g-id in the User properties (10000)
(1)Add the other user (UPDATE: all work and are good)

Add Roles and Features
Added Network Policy and Access Services
Network Policy Server & Host Credential Authorization Protocol
THIS IS A FANTASTICAL, MAGICAL LINK FOR RADIUS WORK: https://www.freeccnaworkbook.com/blog/ccna-security/cisco-ios-radius-authentication-with-windows-server-2012-nps
Followed this link for the step by step process- changed a few things (IP and a name). The next bit is the simmered down version of it:
After adding the role (see bullet #1)…
Under Tools- opening the Network Policy Server…
Right click on the NPS global thing and registered the client (went through the steps…)
Right clicked on RADIUS Clients file (under the RADIUS Clients and Servers folder) and created a new one
Under the Settings tab
Friendly name it (we named it the Cisco c1841 and Cisco c2960x)
IP- resolved it with c1841.group5.itc and c2960x.group5.itc, respectively
The shared secret was created in the Templates (right clicked on the Shared Secrets under Templates Management for ‘New’ and created it to be group5 for it all)
Under the Advanced tab
Vendor name- Cisco. Then clicked ‘ok’ to leave the Wizard.
Under the Policies folder, right clicked on the Network Policies folder and created a new one
Policy name: TheRealKimPossible (Cisco LEVEL 15)
Leave the network access server alone. *next*
Add the User Groups
*Add Groups…*
Object name: Domain Users (check names) *ok*
*Next* Leave the default
*Next* Uncheck the Microsoft defaults and check the Unencrypted authen. (Say no to the dialog box)
Hit *next* on the following screen since we don’t care about that crap…
Then on the Standard RADIUS Attributes
Removed the Framed whatever
Edited the Service-Type to value Login (under the Other radio button)
Under the Vendor Specific
Add the only Cisco Vendor option they give you
Under the Attribute value: shell:priv-lvl=15
After all that is done, went into the c1841 putty session and entered the following:
conf t
aaa group server radius NAP
server-private 10.2.8.3
aaa authentication login default group NAP local
aaa authorization exec default group NAP local if-authenticated
aaa authorization console
Once that one was set up and working (tested it in the c1841 putty- entered the password and it went to the enabled function), ran the sh run command and copy pasta-ed that into the c2960x command line to have it do the same thing-
aaa group server radius NAP
  server-private 10.2.8.3 key group5
aaa authentication login default group NAP local
aaa authentication console
aaa authentication exec default group NAP local if-authenticated
Changed the preferred DNS server IP in Ethernet
127.0.0.1 (verifying against itself so it was possible to just put in ‘c1841’ without the IP
(this was prior to finishing up the RADIUS crap)
 
Get RADIUS set up on the Mikrotik
Check about SSH on the boards- they won’t connect in the Royal TS
Create samba share- without a bunch of errors
Test the win10 box to share with debian
 
Noall
March 30, 2016; 8:50pm
 
IPs (for clarification)
Mikrotik
10.2.8.1 (webFig- put this in the browser search bar)
c2960x
10.2.8.2
WinServer
10.2.8.3
Debian
10.2.8.4
ns1

10.2.8.6
Win10
192.168.209.90
c1841
172.16.48.241
 
 
Ask Lucas to get the WinServer back onto Royal TS…
 
Noall
March 31, 2016; 9:45am
 
Inside the webFig
Radius tab
Add New
Login
domain: group5.itc
Address: 10.2.8.3
Secret: *password*
Authen port: 1812
Account port: 1813
Timeout: 300ms
Systems tab
Users
AAA
Chose ‘Use Radius’ radio button instead
ns2
smb.conf
Added:
workgroup = ns2
realm = group5.itc
dedicated keytab file = FILE:/etc/samba/samba.keytab
kerberos method = dedicated keytab
security = ads
(Tingley joins @11:30am)
Inside Windows Server
NPS
Added mikrotik to RADIUS client
Added network policy for mikrotik
Group policy manager
Password policy
Store passwords using reversible encryption enable
 
We don’t need Radius on ns2 since we did it through the WinServer
See if we can test the Mikrotik for Radius
Possibly need to change the path in [ourfiles] since the home may not be there anymore
*Furnari came in around 2:20ish
