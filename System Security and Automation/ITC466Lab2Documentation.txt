Used the Windows machine to download the Debian ISO.
 

2. Visited the specified IP address on the switch which hosted the ESXi file server, downloaded VMware vSphere.

 

3. Used VMware vSphere to connect to the file server’s datastore.

 

4. Uploaded Debian ISO to datastore, created 2 virtual machines from Linux operating system. Partitioned system resources accordingly.

 

5. Installed sudo and vim on both VMs

Helpful hints: For a syntax run: cat /var/log/syslog | grep named

tail –F /var/log/syslog
named.conf.local
service bind9 restart
ls
Used cd /etc/bind; vi named.conf.options to create the forwarder.
Reverse lookup file: db.8.2.10.in-addr.apra
Numbers he 10.2.8.10/ 10.2.8.15
All that is left from the DNS bit is to create the ns2 as the failover server and writing the zones to files on its own disk.

Got the forward and reverse working on ns1
Installed bind9 on ns2 and tried to finish up the lab by getting ns2 as the failover server and wrote the zones to files on its own disk
resolv.conf 172.16.48.2
Gave read and write permissions to all users
chmod –R a+rw /etc/bind/slave
ns1: iface eth0 inet dhcp
#auto eth0

iface eth0 inet static

address 10.2.8.5
netmask 255.255.254.0
broadcast 10.2.9.255
network 10.2.8.0
gateway 10.2.8.1
Added to ns1- acl, forwarder subnets, recursion 
HH:

named.conf.default-zones
resolv.conf
 

Not writing/ reading from slave- not sure if the permissions are correct. Configuration files might be not correct for the forward/ reverse lookup.

The acl on the master wasn’t needed, the forwarders didn’t need the 10.2.8.-, allow-recursion was added and the IPs needed for that were also added. The slave had the master files copied over to it.

 

HH:

ls –lart(h)
service bind9 stop/ start
scp
cat .bash_history

vi /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
vi /etc/network/interfaces
Commented out the allow-hotplug and the iface eth0 inet dhcp
Enabled the auto eth0
vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
On 184            1
int vlan10
IP helper-address 10.2.8.5
IPv4 setting for the Ethernet and choose to obtain an IP address automatically
CMD
Ipconfig /release
Ipconfig /renew
Ran into the problem of DHCP being loaded, but it wasn’t activating- it didn’t have a static IP on it, and there were some missing quotation marks on the ‘option domain-name’ in vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf 
 

HH

ipconf
vi /etc/network/…….
Service networking restart
dhclient
