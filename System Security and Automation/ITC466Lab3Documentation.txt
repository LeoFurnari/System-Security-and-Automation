*Attempted* to create the firewalls- DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH; to forward acceptance.
Created forward ping and inside network acceptance.

Installed Cygwin for the Win box
Had to go back through to make sure we installed the right packages (including the vim package)
Had to go in through the sshd_config and change the commented out features- looked at the ns2 to make sure the settings were the same
Created a user on the Cygwin to match others
Installed ssh on the ns1 and ns2
Made it so that ‘root’ was blocked, but allowed ‘leo’ (through sshd_config file with the tag AllowUsers and PermitRootLogin as ‘no’)
Created a private key for the ssh holders
~/.ssh$ is the location from the home dir
id_rsa inside of the ~/.ssh$ from the home dir
Made sure that the root was blocked on the boxes 2 and 3
Installed ‘sudo’ on box 2
Apt-get install sudo
Created public keys for ssh access without password
 

Had to re-do all of the public keys…. Here’s the process-

Can connect from debian to ns2
Can connect from debian to ns1
Can connect from ns1 to debian
Can connect from ns1 to ns2
Can connect from ns2 to debian
Can connect from ns2 to ns1
Can connect from windows to debian
Can connect from windows to ns2
Can connect from windows to ns1
Got rid of all the previous ssh pub key files

Commented out the AllowUsers tag; restarted ssh (ns1 (fix sudo: visudo; on debian), ns2)
Changed the name server (vi /etc/resolv.conf)
search group5.itc
nameserver 10.2.8.2
nameserver 10.2.8.6
Deleted the old ssh files on the user accounts with
for i in `ls /home` ; do rm –rf /home/$i/.ssh; done
Created a new ssh for all the users
ssh – keygen
ls –lart
Checked the files (if id_rsa and id_rsa.pub was there then...)
cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
