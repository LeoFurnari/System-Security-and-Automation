SNMP

installed net-snmp on debian, ns1, and ns2 with "sudo apt-get install snmpd"
Create backups for snmp.conf for each.
Changed community Strings in debian, ns1 to those specified by the rubric. Not sure what to do with ns2, due to its absence. Will attempt to recreate it.
Configured snmp on Cisco 1841 and Cisco c2960x by running
"snmp-server community public RO g5pub" for the Read-Only community String
"snmp-server community private RO g5priv" for the Read-Write community String
Ran "snmp-server enable traps syslog" on both routers because it seemed like something that would need to be done to eventually move the system logs over to the LogAnalyzer.
 

Not sure where the snmp directory is on ns2...created directory manually and placed a blank configuration file inside of it.

LogAnalyzer

installed LogAnalyzer on ns2 with "wget http://download.adiscon.com/loganalyzer/loganalyzer-4.1.3.tar.gz"
unzipped the directory into /etc with "tar xzf loganalyzer-4.1.3.tar.gz"

click on IP
go down to snmp
clicked Enabled and communities
In communities added gr5priv(security = private; read-write access ) and gr5pub(security = none read; access only ) no ip address for either, error if one is put in.

Debian, ns1, ns2

changed the smpd.conf file
rocommunity public default g5pub -V systemonly
rocommunity g5pub
rwcommunity g5priv
Ran "snmpwalk -v2c -cg5pub localhost" and "snmpwalk -v2c -cg5priv localhost" to see if it is working (not working on ns2).

Windows server "https://support.managed.com/kb/a764/how-to-install-snmp-and-configure-the-community-string.aspx"
In server manager, Add Roles and Features
went to Features, clicked SNMP Service
Administrative Tools, double  click Services
Right click SNMP Service, go to Security tab
add g5pub and g5priv
apt-get upgrade (ns2)
Changed the snmpd.conf file
Commented out
rocommunity public default g5pub –V systemonly
This got rid of an error on the service snmpd.conf status
Debian will run the snmpd.conf file just fine, but ns1 and ns2 throw up errors. They’re the same file, so it doesn’t make sense. Ask Lucas on LogAnalyzer (how to install- doesn’t make sense with what we’ve seen) and ns2 (snmp not working)

Attempted the LogAnalyzer
Attempted to install check_mk
Broke ns1 with failure
wget *insert web link for the amd64*
dpkg –i *insert jessie_amd64.deb file*
The snmpd.conf file was altered-
Commented out a line, and uncommented out a different line (I’ll be more specific later...)
WHY THIS LAB SUCK. Breaking things all over the place. Hooray.

 

HH:

whereis *insert file*

Installed OMD on ns1
wget http://files.omdistro.org/nightly/1.31.20160406/omd-1.31.20160406.jessie.amd64.deb
Installed it with dpkg
dpkg –i omd-1.31.20160406.jessie.amd64.deb
Solve the errors
apt-get install –f

Moved the extracted loganalyzer pkg to the Apache document root folder
mv loganalyzer-3.6.5/src/ /var/www/html/loganalyzer
mv loganalyzer-3.6.5/contrib/* /var/www/html/loganalyzer/
Set the file permissions to the following files and run the configure.sh script.
# cd /var/www/html/loganalyzer/
chmod +x configure.sh secure.sh
./configure.sh
CISCO 1841
Re-doing the conf
Got rid of:
no snmp-server community public RO g5pub
no snmp-server community private RW g5priv
no snmp-server enable traps syslog
Instead put:
snmp-server enable traps
snmp-server community g5pub RO
snmp-server community g5priv RW
Mikrotik
Added in SNMP
Pub and priv
10.2.8.0/23

 

WHY IS LOGANALYZER IN CODE. WHHHYYYY.

Check_mk- can’t get any of the agents downloaded/ no check_mk file/client anywhere in ns1 (and ns2 if we needed it there)

SNMP works for ns1, ns2, debian, but can’t get it to work on the CISCO items
